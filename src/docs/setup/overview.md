### Setup Options
You have 3 setup options

 1. No Mock Server Setup
 2. Quick Mock Server Setup
 3. Live Environment Setup

All Setup allow you to easily switch the `template` and `theme` by editing the `TEMPLATE`, `window.THEME` respectively in the index.html file  
The `index.html` is git ignored because all further edits are expected to be environment specific, edits not enviroment should be commited on there own
