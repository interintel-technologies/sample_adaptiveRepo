A number pad used to input numbers in an input field with functionality for backspacing(deleting one character at a time) and reseting(clearing everything in the input field).

# Configuration
-The numpad checks all the available number inputs from the event listener and stores the id of the one that is focused in the localstorage. the key is `activeInputId:`. This becomes the active input.
